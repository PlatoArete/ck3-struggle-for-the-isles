# Struggle for The Isles

A comprehensive Crusader Kings III mod focused on the 867 start date, bringing depth and historical flavor to the struggle for dominance across the British Isles.

## Overview

**Struggle for The Isles** transforms the British Isles (Britannia, Isle of Man, Orkney, and the Hebrides) into a dynamic theater of conflict, culture, and faith. Experience the clash between Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Celtic realms, and Norse invaders through a custom Struggle system with meaningful choices and multiple paths to victory.

## Key Features (Planned)

### Political Systems
- **Custom Struggle System** with three phases: Invasion â†’ Consolidation â†’ Hegemony
- **Multiple Resolutions**: Form a Hegemon Empire OR peaceful Confederation of the Isles
- **Unity of the Isles**: Legitimacy system tracking your realm's stability and influence (0-100 scale)
- **Confederation Mechanics**: Rule as High King of High Kings with council votes and stability challenges

### Religion Paths
- **Roman Dominance**: Catholic supremacy with papal benefits
- **Insular Resurgence**: Revived Insular Christianity with unique head and holy order
- **Norse Victorious**: Raiding economy with sea-king syncretism options
- **Old Gods Stir**: Revive Goidelic, Brythonic, or Hellenic paganism
- **Syncretic Faith**: Forge the tolerant "Faith of the Isles" blending traditions

### Culture Systems
- **Melting Pot Culture**: Unified "Isles" culture with communal ethos
- **Hegemon's Divergence**: Imperial culture variants (English/Norse/Gaelic)
- **Cultural Acceptance** mechanics tied to Unity system

### Regional Building Chains
- **Burhs** (Anglo-Saxon): Timber â†’ Stone â†’ Royal Burh with defensive auras
- **DÃºns** (Celtic): Hill â†’ Stone â†’ Royal DÃºn / Fortified Monastery
- **Longphorts** (Norse): Coastal bases â†’ Fortified â†’ Sea-King's Haven

### Military & Levies
- **Fyrd System** (Anglo-Saxon): Lower numbers, higher morale and home defense
- **Ceithernn** (Celtic): Mobile forces with terrain advantages
- **Leidang** (Norse): Naval focus with raid bonuses
- **Unique MaA**: Huscarls, GallÃ³glaigh, Hersir's Huscarls, Warriors of the Isles

### Court & Retainers
- **High Reeve**: Control and tax bonuses
- **Ollamh/Court Bard**: Prestige and cultural acceptance
- **Hersir**: Raid income optimization
